# 90POE Data Science Take Home Test: AirBnb Price Prediction

This repository outlines my approach to the 90 POE's Take Home Task. The given data is detailed listing information for AirBnb properties in Berlin. The goal of the task was open and an opportunity to showcase my strengths. I aim to answer these questions:

* What insights can you gather ? 
* How can you visualize the data ? 
* What is suprising for you about the data?
* Create a ML model that can predict the listing price from the other information in the data file, then evaluate your model.

## Getting Started
This repository aims to explain the process of how I handled the project. I used jupyter-notebooks to make my data analysis process more visibly clear and interpretable. Since the task has also a presentation, I included some visualizations on the Exploratory Data Analysis part.(EDA)


* `eda.ipynb` is the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing notebook.

Tells us the distribution of all bookable places on airbnb Berlin but it is hard to generalize. Therefore
I made this interactive map instead of previous plot where you can also see every neighbourhood and their mean prices:
