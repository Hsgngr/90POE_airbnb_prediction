When I am at home, I expect you to behave as you would with a housemate. There are also some rules that I would request to be considered: No noise or music after 21:00, or on Sundays. The building is really old and neighbours can literally hear everything. Unfortunately this cannot be a party flat.  No shoes in the flat. Please keep the flat tidy and clean (ex. wash your own dishes, remove hair from drain after showering) and be sensible with spending water and electricity.  When leaving the apartment, please turn off the heating and lock the door.  All downloading, uploading and streaming is strictly forbidden, unless it's through a legal account that you have paid for. I hate this rule myself, but hey, this is Germany... Your pet is welcome and smoking is allowed everywhere in the flat.                                                                                    0.000080\n",
